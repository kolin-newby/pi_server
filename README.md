Bennett Miller, Kolin Newby, Aidan Oâ€™Connor, Sam Sly, Ria Thakkar, Yi Wu

The goal of this project is to create software that will collect data on the decibal volume of a given location and display said data
to the user of the software via a web interface.

The practical use of this software would be to allow a given user to determine the traffic/business of a given area in order to inform
there decision on where to go.

The target user of this software, in our case, would be college students looking for the quietest places to study on campus; however,
this software would be applicable to many other use cases, such as street traffic in a city or the sound traffic in any business location.
